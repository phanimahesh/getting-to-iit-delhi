# Auto-Rickshaw

The most iconic symbol of public transport in India, if there was one, would surely be the three-wheeled yellowish-green Auto-rickshaw. These colourful beasts command a gargantuan proportion of the otherwise black-and-white Delhi roads, cutting by, swishing and zigzagging past many-an-irritated drivers. But beware -- auto rickshaw drivers have a reputation of overcharging their passengers and not running by meters. Excuses like "meter not working" or "Savaari nahi milegi" are commonplace, so do not fall for them -- always insist on travelling by meter. If the driver refuses, walk away (slowly, and wait for him to call you back). That said, here is what you need to know --

When coming from the New Delhi/Nizamuddin Railway Stations, you will find a Pre-Paid Auto-rickshaw booth just outside the station. There will usually be a huge crowd around this booth, but if you cannot find it, ask a traffic policemen (they are responsible for regulating the pre-paid booths). Once you declare your destination and pay the respective amount, the official at the booth will give you a receipt. Keep it SAFE, for it has to be returned to the auto-rickshaw driver at the end of the journey, for him to earn his bread & butter.

The rates for Auto-rickshaws in Delhi are:  
For first 2 kilometres -- Rs. 19  
For every consequent kilometre -- Rs. 6.50/km

For example, the distance from NDLS to IIT is approximately 13.6 km., so the appropriate charge for an Auto would be Rs. 94.4. You may round it off to the nearest greatest integer. Consider it a tip of sorts.

**Our suggestion:** After the Metro, this is your second-best option. If this is your first visit to Delhi and you wish to experience the city in all its glory, then for the now-buried JEE's sake, take an Auto!
